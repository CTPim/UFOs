# UFOs


### Overview of Project
(all required files all located in the Challenge Folder)

The purpose of this project is to update the UFO Sightings website in order to provide a more in-depth analysis. The website will now allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Filters for city, state, country, and shape of UFO have been added. 


### Results

By using the search boxes, a user can narrow down and filter a UFO sighting by date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO. The table will update depending on which critieria is being searched. A user is able to search by using all filters simultaneously allowing them to narrow down a specific search.

### Summary

- A drawback of this design is not knowing what criteria to search for. For example, the user may not realize that "light" is considered a shape of a UFO, thus this can limit a user's search ability. 
- A recommendation would be to display all searchable criteria. Instead of a textbox where the user inputs a word, a drop-down list is preferred. 
- Another recommendation is for the user to be able to save recent searches in the text box.
